[![FlowCiao Tests](https://github.com/Kingfish219/FlowCiao/actions/workflows/FlowCiaoBuildWorkflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kingfish219/FlowCiao/actions/workflows/FlowCiaoBuildWorkflow.yml) [![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/FlowCiao?label=Nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlowCiao/)

FlowCiao is a lightweight, user-friendly and extensible .NET state machine-based workflow that simplifies the creation and management of state machines in your applications. With FlowCiao, you can effortlessly define and control the flow of your application's logic. It will also contains a powerful server and a designer interface which will be explained later in the document.\
We prefer the term **"Flow"** instead of **"State Machine"**. Why "Flow"? because The term "Flow" captures the dynamic essence of the process. Like water flowing through paths, a Flow progresses through states guided by rules and conditions, making it a more intuitive term.

## Simplicity

Define your flow using an Easy-to-use and Fluent API

```csharp
builder
    .Initial(stepBuilder =>
    {
        stepBuilder
            .For(States.Idle)
            .Allow(States.Ringing, Triggers.Ring)
            .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Call)
    })
    .NewStep(stepBuilder =>
    {
        stepBuilder
            .For(States.Ringing)
            .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Pickup)
            .Allow(States.Idle, Triggers.Hangup)
    });
```

## Getting Started

To get started with FlowCiao, follow these steps:

1. Install FlowCiao via NuGet Package Manager.
2. Create your custom flow by implementing the `IFlowPlanner` interface.
3. Give it a unique `Key`
4. Define your States, Transitions, and Triggers using the fluent API provided by FlowCiao.
5. Start managing states and flows effortlessly in your application.

## Example

Here's a simple example of creating a flow for implementing a simple [Phone](https://github.com/Kingfish219/FlowCiao/tree/main/samples/FlowCiao.Samples.Phone/) machine with FlowCiao:

```csharp
public class PhoneFlow : IFlowPlanner
{
    public string Key { get; set; } = "phone";

    public IFlowBuilder Plan(IFlowBuilder builder)
    {
        builder
            .Initial(stepBuilder =>
            {
                stepBuilder
                    .For(States.Idle)
                    .Allow(States.Ringing, Triggers.Ring)
                    .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Call)
                    .OnEntry<PhoneOnEnterIdleActivity>()
                    .OnExit<PhoneOnExitIdleActivity>();
            })
            .NewStep(stepBuilder =>
            {
                stepBuilder
                    .For(States.Ringing)
                    .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Pickup)
                    .Allow(States.Idle, Triggers.Hangup)
                    .OnExit<PhoneOnExitIdleActivity>();
            });

        return builder;
    }
}
```

Add FlowCiao to your project:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFlowCiao();
```

Then **Build** your desired flow using `IFlowBuilder` interface and **Fire** it by calling `CiaoAndTriggerAsync()`:

```csharp
var flowBuilder = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFlowBuilder>();
var flow = flowBuilder.Build<PhoneFlow>();

var flowOperator = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService<IFlowOperator>();
await flowOperator.CiaoAndTriggerAsync(flow.Key, Triggers.Call);
```

## Persistency if required

If there is a need to persist your flows for long-running processes, you can connect FlowCiao to database providers (For now, Sql Server and other providers very soon!).
Otherwise, as long as your application is running, We track the status and data of all of your running flows. So no wories:)

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFlowCiao(settings =>
{
    settings
        .Persist(persistenceSettings =>
        {
            persistenceSettings.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("FlowCiao"));
        });
});
```

## Activities

In FlowCiao, an `Activity` is a custom class that you can create and use as part of your flow's process. These objects play a crucial role in defining the behavior of your flow when entering or exiting a state.

### OnEntry and OnExit

`OnEntry` and `OnExit` are two key methods associated with each State in your flow and can be declared as you've seen earlier in PhoneFlow. They represent the actions that should be performed when a State is entered (`OnEntry`) and when a State is exited (`OnExit`).

### Custom Activities

With FlowCiao, you have the flexibility to define your own `Activity` classes. These custom classes can encapsulate any logic or functionality you need to execute as part of the `OnEntry` or `OnExit` process. This could include anything from logging and data validation to complex business logic. For creating such activities, you should implement the `IFlowActivity` interface and override the `Execute` method. Here is an example:

```csharp
public class PhoneOnExitIdleActivity : IFlowActivity
{
    public void Execute(FlowStepContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Phone exited idle state: caller id: {context.Data["CallerId"]}");

        context.Data["Location"] = "USA";
    }
}
```

### Passing Data
As you can see, the `Execute` method takes a `FlowStepContext` parameter, which is a special object that contains a **dictionary**. This dictionary can be filled with any data you want to pass between activities during a transition.
You can then initialize this data and pass it in the process of triggering your flow:
```csharp
var data = new Dictionary<object, object>
{
    { "CallerId", 12134664789 }
}; 
await flowOperator.CiaoAndTriggerAsync(flow.Key, Triggers.Call, data);
```

***Limitaion**: this data is only available during a transition and will not be accessible in the next Trigger*

## Other Features

There are plenty of additional functionalities for better managing your Flows. Here are some of them
- You can monitor the current running or finished instances of your flow using the following command
    ```csharp
    var flowService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<FlowService>();
    var flow = await flowService.GetByKey(key: key);

    var flowInstanceService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<FlowInstanceService>();
    var flowInstances = await flowInstanceService.Get(flow.Id);
    ```
- Instead of using `CiaoAndTriggerAsync()`, you can First initialize a new instance of your Flow using `Ciao()` and then Trigger it whenever you wish using `TiggerAsync()` which accepts the same arguments as `CiaoAndTriggerAsync()`
    ```csharp
        var flowOperator = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService<IFlowOperator>();
        var flowInstance = await flowOperator.Ciao(flow.Key);
        var result = await flowOperator.TriggerAsync(flowInstance, Triggers.Call);
    ```
- **JSON:** you can also export and import flow definitions as JSON
    ```csharp
    var flowJsonSerializer = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<FlowJsonSerializer>();
    
    // Export
    var flow = await _flowService.GetByKey(key: "phone");
    var definition = flowJsonSerializer.Export(flow);

    // Import
    var flowFromDefinition = flowJsonSerializer.Import(definition);
    ```

# Welcome to FlowCiao Studio

**FlowCiao Studio** is an important part of the FlowCiao project, a powerful platform built upon **FlowCiao** that enables the creation and management of flows using a Restful API. You can use it to orchestrate your business workflows.

## How to Use

hereâ€™s how you can run FlowCiao Studio and access its Swagger documentation:

1. Download FlowCiao repository from Github

2. Open your **terminal** and navigate to the directory where FlowCiao Studio project is located.

3. Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to start Studio:

```bash
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:9600"
```

### Accessing Swagger Documentation

FlowCiao Studio includes a built-in Swagger UI, an interactive documentation about API interface.

Once the server is running, open your web browser.
In the address bar, enter the following URL:\
**http://localhost:9600/swagger**

This will take you to the Swagger UI where you can view and interact with its APIâ€™s endpoints.

Remember, the server needs to be running to access the Swagger UI. If you stop it, the Swagger UI will not be accessible.

*Please replace `localhost` with the appropriate server address if you're not running the server on your local machine.*

<br>

## And the Juicy Part: Designer ðŸŽ¨
That's not all. FlowCiao Studio goes beyond being just a server. It also includes a **Designer**, providing a visual interface that makes flow creation intuitive and straightforward. Here is a peek at what it looks like:
